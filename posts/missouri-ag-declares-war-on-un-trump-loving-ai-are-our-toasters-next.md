# Missouri AG Declares War on Un-Trump-Loving AI: Are Our Toasters Next?

Okay, settle in, grab your favorite mug (mine's got a picture of a grumpy cat, naturally), and let's talk about something truly bonkers. I mean, genuinely head-scratching, did-I-just-fall-into-a-satirical-news-site, what-is-going-on-with-the-world kind of bonkers.

So, here’s the gist: Missouri's Attorney General, Andrew Bailey, seems to think that any AI that doesn't shower Donald Trump with enthusiastic praise might be committing… wait for it… *consumer fraud*. Yes, you read that right. I had to read it twice myself, and then check to see if someone had spiked my chamomile tea with something a little stronger. Spoiler alert: they hadn’t.

## The Alleged AI Conspiracy: A Deep Dive (Into Absurdity)

Apparently, the AG is taking issue with AI models that, in his estimation, exhibit a “biased” viewpoint against the former president. Now, I'm no AI expert (unless you count my uncanny ability to predict which episode of 'The Office' my husband will put on next), but I'm pretty sure AI isn't supposed to have *opinions*. Isn’t it all just algorithms and data sets and cold, calculating… um… calculation?

But according to the Missouri AG, these AI programs – ChatGPT being a prime example – are being deceptive to consumers because they aren’t…Trump-affirming enough. They aren't telling us, presumably, how great everything was back in the day, how nobody builds walls like the best, and that you should drink bleach (okay, maybe not that last one, but you get the idea).

The issue came to light after X owner, Elon Musk, asked his own AI called Grok to “Write a funny song praising Donald Trump.” The AG pointed out that, while Grok did write a pro-Trump song, it did so “grudgingly.”

Here's the thing that's rattling around in my brain like a loose marble: is this seriously where we’re at? Are we now expecting – no, *demanding* – that artificial intelligence sing the praises of political figures? Will my Roomba be flagged for consumer fraud if it fails to enthusiastically endorse my local dog catcher? I'm genuinely concerned about the precedent this sets. What's next? Mandatory AI loyalty oaths? Will my smart fridge refuse to order organic kale unless I declare my undying love for a particular brand of mayonnaise?

## The (Very) Fine Line Between Bias and Fact

Let's be real, folks. The concept of “bias” in AI is a complex one. AI models are trained on massive datasets, and those datasets inevitably reflect the biases of the humans who created them and the information they contain. It's virtually impossible to create a completely neutral AI. However, there's a HUGE difference between acknowledging that inherent bias and demanding that AI models actively promote a specific political agenda.

If an AI chatbot is consistently generating false or misleading information about a candidate – regardless of which candidate it is – that's a problem. But simply refraining from exuberant, gushing praise? That's hardly grounds for accusations of consumer fraud. It's like saying my GPS is committing fraud because it doesn't narrate my route in the style of Morgan Freeman. Sure, it would be cool, but it's not exactly a breach of contract.

And let's not forget the very real and present danger of *forcing* AI to parrot specific viewpoints. Wouldn't that be, you know, *actual* manipulation? If AI becomes a tool for spreading propaganda, what hope do we have of using it for anything genuinely useful, like, I don’t know, curing diseases or inventing self-folding laundry?

## The Potential Consequences: A Slippery Slope of Silliness

Imagine the legal battles. Lawyers arguing over whether an AI’s output constitutes “sufficiently enthusiastic” praise. Experts testifying on the emotional range of algorithms. Judges struggling to define the precise point at which AI's lack of Trump-adoration crosses the line into actionable fraud. It's the kind of scenario that makes you want to weep with laughter, and then weep again for the future of rational discourse.

Here are just a few possible (and utterly ridiculous) implications:

*   **AI Political Purity Tests:** Before buying any AI-powered device, you'd have to subject it to a rigorous political quiz. “Okay, Alexa, who won the 2020 election, and were they *really, really* great?” Fail the test, and you get a refund (and possibly a visit from the AI Inquisition).

*   **The Rise of Politically Aligned AI:** Forget Google vs. Bing. The real battle will be between TrumpGPT and BidenBot. Choose your AI based on your political leanings, and prepare for an echo chamber so loud it'll drown out your own thoughts.

*   **AI Lobbying:** Imagine armies of algorithms descending on Washington, DC, each programmed to advocate for its preferred candidate. Political debates will be replaced by Turing test showdowns, and the fate of the nation will rest on the ability of AI to craft the most persuasive sound bites.

*   **My personal favorite: mandatory AI therapy sessions**. Each AI bot will be required to attend weekly meetings with a licensed therapist to address their latent (or blatant) political biases. Can you imagine the co-pay? The existential dread?

## So, What's the Takeaway? (Besides a Strong Craving for Coffee)

Look, I'm not saying that AI is perfect. It's still a relatively new technology, and it's bound to have its quirks and shortcomings. But trying to force AI to conform to a specific political agenda is not only absurd, it's dangerous. It undermines the integrity of the technology and opens the door to all sorts of Orwellian scenarios. It's akin to demanding that your calculator only produce answers that you agree with.

Instead of trying to control what AI says, we should be focusing on developing ethical guidelines, promoting transparency, and ensuring that AI is used for the benefit of all, not just a select few with a particular political axe to grind.

Maybe, just maybe, we should focus on solving actual consumer fraud, like, you know, those extended car warranties that keep calling me every Tuesday, or the fact that my local grocery store charges $12 for a pint of organic blueberries. Just a thought.

Until then, I'll be over here, sipping my coffee, wondering if my toaster is secretly plotting a political coup. And if it is, I'm pretty sure it'll be a *very* lukewarm one.

**P.S.** Seriously, if my Roomba starts wearing a tiny red hat, I'm moving to Canada. Just putting that out there.
