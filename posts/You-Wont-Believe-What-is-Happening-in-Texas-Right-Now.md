Hey friend ☕,

I just couldn’t keep this to myself today. You might have seen a snippet in your feed, a hashtag on X,but Texas is in the midst of a heartbreaking nightmare.

**Historic flash floods swept through the Texas Hill Country from July 4–7**, dumping over **5–20 inches of rain** in just hours. The Guadalupe River surged up to **26 feet in 45 minutes**, submerging homes, ripping away cabins, and catching people off guard as they slept :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

Here’s what’s truly shattered me:

- At least **104 people are confirmed dead**, including **28 children** , many from Camp Mystic, an all-girls summer camp, where cabins were swallowed by water :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
- Rescue teams pulled over **850 survivors** from the floodwaters, using boats and helicopters while the Coast Guard and National Guard joined the mission :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
- Camp Mystic alone lost **27 campers and counselors**, missing many more, after the river jumped its banks with terrifying speed :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.
- The disaster struck on a holiday weekend, giving little warning,even the mayor lamented, _“We didn’t even have a warning”_ :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.

## 💔 Moments that stopped me in my tracks

I imagine the surreal scene: rooftop rescues, cabins floating downriver, a soaked teddy bear drifting on a curb… And that image of a dad carrying his little girl above waist-deep water,coffee in hand, I just paused and felt the weight.

Then there’s the story of 7‑year‑old Brock climbing rafters to stay above water, clutching onto hope in the darkness :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.

Or the eerie quiet of Hunt’s iconic 80‑year‑old Hunt Store,once a buzzing community hub,now shut after flood damage :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.

## 👐 Hope isn’t lost,people are rising

- **Over 1,750 state personnel**, 975 vehicles, and 400 federal agents are on the ground, continuing rescue and recovery efforts :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.
- The **NBA, NBPA and teams** (Mavericks, Rockets, Spurs) donated over **$2 million** – lit a small flame in dark days :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.
- Relief agencies like **Direct Relief** and **American Red Cross** are providing meds, clean-up kits, shelters, mental‑health support, and reunification centers :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.
- Even **Amazon** swung into action, coordinating donations and emergency goods with on‑site partners :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}.

## 🌧 Why it happened,and why it hit so hard

Central Texas sits in what weather experts call _“Flash Flood Alley”_. Combine the hilly terrain, clay‑rich soil, and a stalled storm system (fed by remnants of Tropical Storm Barry) , and boom: a recipe for swift, deadly flooding :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}.

On July 4, 6–10 inches of rain fell in mere hours,more than many places get in a month. There were early **Flash Flood Emergencies** issued, but the storm’s fury arrived so fast it overwhelmed the warnings :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}.

## ☕ My coffee‑table takeaway today

It's easy to scroll past tragedy, numbed by swirling headlines. But today,today I slowed down. I held my breath for those missing campers, wept for counselors like Chloe (a 19‑year‑old counselor who loved those girls dearly) :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}.

So here's my simple ask: when the day ends and you slip under your cozy blanket, whisper a prayer for Kerr County. If you can, chip in to relief efforts,even $5 helps. Every kind thought and act is a lifeline right now.

Life’s coffee notes just got darker,let’s be the sugar that reminds us all we care.

Thanks for sitting here with me. ❤️

Warmly,  
Michael
