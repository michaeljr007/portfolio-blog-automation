Hey friend ☕,

I just couldn’t keep this to myself today. You might have seen it in passing, a news snippet on your feed, a trending tag on Twitter, but Texas is going through something truly heartbreaking right now.

**Historic floods have swallowed up entire communities.**  
I mean, we’re talking about families clinging to rooftops, pets being rescued by strangers on makeshift rafts, people losing everything in the blink of an eye. It’s the kind of thing that makes your chest tighten, isn’t it?

It’s hard not to get emotional. I found myself staring out my window this morning, coffee in hand, feeling strangely guilty that the sun was shining here while people there were wading through water up to their necks.

What really gets me are the small details. A soaked teddy bear washed up on a curb. A dad carrying his little girl on his shoulders, her arms wrapped tight around his head. Volunteers, absolute angels, handing out sandwiches and dry socks like it’s the most normal thing in the world to be waist-deep in floodwater.

I think sometimes we get numb to tragedy because the internet moves so fast. Yesterday it was something else, tomorrow it’ll be another story. But today? Today, Texas needs us to pause.

So maybe tonight, when you’re settling into bed, whisper a little prayer for the families trying to salvage photo albums and baby shoes from muddy water. Or if you’re able, maybe drop a small donation to relief groups on the ground. Even a kind thought sent their way is a tiny light in the darkness.

Anyway, I know this isn’t my usual cozy chat about web apps or why coffee is basically a love language. But sometimes the world demands we stop and feel deeply.

Thanks for sitting with me through this. ❤️

Talk soon,
Michael
